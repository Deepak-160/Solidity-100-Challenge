Solidity Smart Contract Playground
Hey there—welcome to my Solidity practice repository.

This repo is basically my personal collection of smart contracts I’m writing as I learn and explore Ethereum development. Everything here is purely for educational purposes. You’ll find different examples covering common patterns, experiments, and small demos.

What You’ll Find Here
Right now, I’ve got a few contracts in here, and I’ll be adding more as I go. For example:

Leaderboard Contract
A simple leaderboard where you can add addresses with scores, rearrange entries, and remove the lowest-ranked.

Basic Storage and Retrieval
Some straightforward examples using mappings, arrays, and structs.

Access Control Samples
Contracts showing ownership and permission logic.

Token Logic Experiments (coming soon)
Planning to include ERC20-like examples to practice token mechanics.

How to Use These Contracts
If you want to try them yourself, you can:

Remix IDE
Easiest way—just copy the contract code into Remix, compile, and deploy right in your browser.

Hardhat
If you prefer Hardhat, make sure you have Node.js installed, then run:

python
npx hardhat compile

and set up deployment or tests however you like.

Feel free to tweak the code, break things, and see what happens—this is the best way to actually understand Solidity.

Why This Exists
I made this repo to:

Practice Solidity in a focused way

Keep track of my progress over time

Share examples that might help someone else starting out

Get feedback and improve

Important Note
Just a heads-up—these contracts are not audited and aren’t meant for production use. They might have bugs or missing security checks. Always review and test thoroughly before thinking about any real deployment.

Feedback & Contributions
If you see something that could be improved, have suggestions, or just want to chat about Solidity, feel free to open an issue or pull request.

I’m always open to ideas and learning from others.

More contracts coming soon—thanks for checking this out!
