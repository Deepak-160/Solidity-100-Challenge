# Solidity Smart Contract Playground

This repository is a collection of Solidity smart contracts developed to practice and demonstrate core concepts in Ethereum smart contract development. The examples here cover a range of patterns and features and are intended for educational and reference purposes.

---

## Overview

The repository includes sample contracts illustrating:

- **Leaderboard Management**
  - Adding addresses with associated scores
  - Reordering leaderboard positions
  - Removing and replacing entries
- **Basic Storage Patterns**
  - Mappings, arrays, and combinations of both
- **Access Control Examples**
  - Ownership and permission mechanisms
- **Token Logic Samples** *(planned)*
  - Simple ERC20-style balance management

Additional contracts will be added over time as the project evolves.

## Getting Started

You can compile, deploy, and test these contracts in a few different environments:

### Using Remix IDE

- Navigate to [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/)
- Create a new file, paste the contract code, and compile
- Deploy and interact via the Remix interface

### Using Hardhat

- Install dependencies:

  ```bash
  npm install --save-dev hardhat
