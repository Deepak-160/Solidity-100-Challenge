Solidity Smart Contract Playground
This repository is a collection of Solidity smart contracts developed to practice and demonstrate core concepts in Ethereum smart contract development. The examples here cover a range of patterns and features, and are intended for educational and reference purposes.
________________________________________
Overview
The repository includes sample contracts illustrating:
•	Leaderboard Management
o	Adding addresses with associated scores
o	Reordering leaderboard positions
o	Removing and replacing entries
•	Basic Storage Patterns
o	Mappings, arrays, and combinations of both
•	Access Control Examples
o	Ownership and permission mechanisms
•	Token Logic Samples (planned)
o	Simple ERC20-style balance management
Additional contracts will be added over time as the project evolves.

Getting Started
You can compile, deploy, and test these contracts in a few different environments:
Using Remix IDE:
•	Navigate to Remix
•	Create a new file, paste the contract code, and compile
•	Deploy and interact via the Remix interface
Using Hardhat:
•	Install dependencies:
bash
npm install --save-dev hardhat
•	Compile contracts:
bash
npx hardhat compile
•	Set up scripts to deploy or test as needed
Feel free to adapt the code and experiment to deepen your understanding of Solidity.

Objectives
This project is intended to:
•	Build proficiency with Solidity syntax and common patterns
•	Create a reference base of practical examples
•	Serve as a foundation for more advanced contract development
•	Share learnings with the community

Disclaimer
These contracts are not production-ready and have not been audited. They may contain bugs, simplifications, or incomplete logic for clarity.
Do not deploy these contracts to a production environment without performing thorough security reviews and testing.
